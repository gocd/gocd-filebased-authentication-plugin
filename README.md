# GoCD File Based Authentication Plugin

This is a file based authentication plugin which implements the GoCD [Authorization Plugin](https://plugin-api.gocd.io/current/authorization/) endpoint. This plugin allows authentication/search of users defined in password files.

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`

## Installation

- From GoCD `17.5.0` onwards the plugin comes bundled along with server, hence a separate installation is not required.

## Usage instructions

The plugin uses the popular file format used by the `htpasswd` program:

    username:hashed-password

The plugin currently supports passwords hashed using `bcrypt`, `PBKDF2` and `SHA1`. See [#13](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-filebased-authentication-plugin/issues/13) for details.

> **Note**: It is highly recommended that users use passwords hashed using `bcrypt` and not `SHA1`.

You can put as many username/hashed password pairs as you like -- use a new line for each one

## Generating password using cli-app

You can use the [gocd-passwd](https://github.com/gocd/gocd-filebased-authentication-plugin/tree/master/gocdpasswd) to generate hashed password file entry.

Use the following command to generate bcrypt hashed password file entry,  

```bash
$ java -jar gocdpasswd.jar -B -u username -p password
```

Where, `-B` forces password hashing with bcrypt, However you can also use `-P` for PBKDF2SHA1 and `-S` for PBKDF2SHA256

## Generating passwords using `htpasswd`

You can use the [htpasswd](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/htpasswd.html) program from Apache to manage your password file.

So for example, you can use the following command to create a password file called `passwd` and put the password for the user "user" in it:

```shell
htpasswd -c -B passwd user
```
Where, `-B` forces password hashing with bcrypt, currently considered to be very secure. You can also use `-s` for SHA or `-d` for crypt() but these are deemed insecure

### htpasswd on Windows

The `htpasswd` executable may be downloaded as part of the apache distribution from [Apache Haus](http://www.apachehaus.com/cgi-bin/download.plx) or [Apache Lounge](https://www.apachelounge.com/download/). Note that these executables may not work on Windows XP or Server 2003

### htpasswd on Mac OSX

htpasswd is already installed by default on Mac OSX.

### htpasswd on Linux

Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) htpasswd can be installed from the apache2-utils

```shell
$ apt-get install apache2-utils
```

### Generating passwords using python

Another option is to use the following command (assumes python is installed on your system)

```shell
$ python -c "import sha; from base64 import b64encode; print b64encode(sha.new('my-password').digest())"
```

## Configuration

The plugin needs to be configured to use the password file. The configuration can be added by adding a Authorization Configuration by visiting the Authorization Configuration page under *Admin > Security*.

Alternatively, the configuration can be added directly to the `config.xml` using the `<authConfig>` configuration.

* Example Configuration

    ```xml
    <authConfigs>
      <authConfig id="auth-config-id" pluginId="cd.go.authentication.passwordfile">
        <property>
          <key>PasswordFilePath</key>
          <value>path-to-password-file</value>
        </property>
      </authConfig>
    </authConfigs>
    ```

* The plugin can also be configured to use multiple password files if required:

    ```xml
    <authConfigs>
      <authConfig id="auth-config-id-1" pluginId="cd.go.authentication.passwordfile">
        <property>
          <key>PasswordFilePath</key>
          <value>path-to-password-file-1</value>
        </property>
      </authConfig>
      <authConfig id="auth-config-id-2" pluginId="cd.go.authentication.passwordfile">
        <property>
          <key>PasswordFilePath</key>
          <value>path-to-password-file-2</value>
        </property>
      </authConfig>
    </authConfigs>
    ```

## Troubleshooting

### Verify Connection

For a given Authorization Configuration verify if the given password file can be accessed by the plugin. The Authorization Configuration page under *Admin > Security* gives an option to verify connection.

### Enable Debug Logs

#### If you are on GoCD version 19.6 and above:

Edit the file `wrapper-properties.conf` on your GoCD server and add the following options. The location of the `wrapper-properties.conf` can be found in the [installation documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/installing_go_server.html) of the GoCD server.

 ```properties
# We recommend that you begin with the index `100` and increment the index for each system property
wrapper.java.additional.100=-Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.passwordfile.log.level=debug
```

If you're running with GoCD server 19.6 and above on docker using one of the supported GoCD server images, set the environment variable `GOCD_SERVER_JVM_OPTS`:

 ```shell
docker run -e "GOCD_SERVER_JVM_OPTS=-Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.passwordfile.log.level=debug" ...
```

#### If you are on GoCD version 19.5 and lower:

* On Linux:

    Enabling debug level logging can help you troubleshoot an issue with this plugin. To enable debug level logs, edit the file `/etc/default/go-server` (for Linux) to add:

    ```shell
    export GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES="$GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES -Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.passwordfile.log.level=debug"
    ```

    If you're running the server via `./server.sh` script:

    ```shell
    $ GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES="-Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.passwordfile.log.level=debug" ./server.sh
    ```

* On windows:

    Edit the file `config/wrapper-properties.conf` inside the GoCD Server installation directory (typically `C:\Program Files\Go Server`):

    ```
    # config/wrapper-properties.conf
    # since the last "wrapper.java.additional" index is 15, we use the next available index.
    wrapper.java.additional.16=-Dplugin.cd.go.authentication.passwordfile.log.level=debug
    ```
